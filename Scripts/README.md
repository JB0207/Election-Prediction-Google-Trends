# Scripts Directory Overview

This directory contains the scripts used to perform data collection, processing, modeling, and analysis as described in the main project README. Below is a detailed description of each script and the files they generate.

## Scripts and Their Outputs

### 1_Step_1_collect_polling_data.R
- **Purpose:** Collects polling data from various polling companies in Germany.
- **Output:** Generates `data_polls_*.csv` files which contain the polling data used for comparative analyses.

### 2_Step_2_collect_GT_data.R
- **Purpose:** Collects raw Google Trends data at hourly intervals.
- **Output:** Produces `.RData` files in the `Data/Data_raw` folder containing overlapping Google Trends data points.

### 3_Step_3_subset_GT_data.R
- **Purpose:** Filters and subsets the Google Trends data to select unique data points.
- **Output:** Moves the filtered `.RData` files to the `Data/Data_GT` folder ensuring each dataset is distinct.

### 4_Step_4_predictive_modelling.R
- **Purpose:** Builds predictive models based on the cleaned Google Trends data and polling data.
- **Output:** Creates model output files that detail the predictions and their accuracies.

### 5_Step_5_generate_paper.qmd
- **Purpose:** Analyses the predictions, generates visualizations, and compiles the findings into the final paper.
- **Output:** Produces the final paper document, including charts and tables that summarize the study's findings.

## Additional Files Generated by Scripts
- `data_GT_data_set_comparisons.csv`: Comparison of the quality of datasets.
- `data_GT_datasets_good.csv`: The chosen datasets.
- `data_models.csv`: Final df structure.
- `data_predictions_final_mean.csv`: Final dataset with all predictions.
- `..._sonstige.csv`: Same as above, but including the parties "sonstige" for comparison.
