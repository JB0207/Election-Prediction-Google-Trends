1_Step_1_collect_polling_data.R

- Collects polling data from different polling institutes (Infratest Dimap is used for main comparison)
- Creates "data_polls_....csv" files that contain polling data.

- to-do
  - Change infratest dimap to one dataset with sonstige and omit sonstige later when loading it

2_Step_2_collect_GT_data.R

- This file is used to collect GT data hourly over several days
- Data is stored in "Data_raw" folder (anpassen without category!)


3_Step_3_subset_GT_data.R

- This file is used to compare the collected GT datasets that are stored within ".RData" files. 
- Subsequently, only ".Rdata" files are used (1 per day) where all the GT datasets are different from previous ones.

4_Step_4_predictive_modelling.R

- This file loads the GT datasets stored in ".\Data" and the polling data and
builds the different predictive models that are analyzed in the paper.
- "append_other_pools_to_data.R" (find file)
- to-do
  - Copy "Merged_syntax_Sonstige.R" and "Merged_syntax_WC.R" to "4_Step_4_predictive_modelling.R"
   - subvectors "relevant_rows"
   - save "data_models", "data_predictions_final", "data_predictions", "data_comparisons2" as csv files
