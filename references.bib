First, building on previous studies, we show how errors in national polls evolve in a structured way over the election timeline. Second, we examine errors in polls in the final week of the election campaign to assess performance across election years. Third, we undertake a pooled analysis of polling errors—controlling for a number of institutional and party features—that enables us to test whether poll errors have increased or decreased over time. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the recent performance of polls has not been outside the ordinary. However, the performance of polls does vary across political contexts and in understandable ways.},

Our purpose is to conduct a comprehensive and objective research into how the public use of Big Data from web searches has affected research, and furthermore, to discuss the implications of Google Trends in terms of Big Data utilization and application. To this end, we conducted a network analysis on 657 research papers that used Google Trends. We also identified the important nodes of the networks and reviewed the research directions of representative papers. The study reveals that Google Trends is used to analyze various variables in a wide range of areas, including IT, communications, medicine, health, business and economics. In addition, this study shows that research using Google Trends has increased dramatically in the last decade, and in the process, the focus of research has shifted to forecasting changes, whereas in the past the focus had been on merely describing and diagnosing research trends, such as surveillance and monitoring. This study also demonstrates that in recent years, there has been an expansion in analysis in linkage with other social Big Data sources, as researchers attempt to overcome the limitations of using only search information. Our study will provide various insights for researchers who utilize Google Trends as well as researchers who rely on various other sources of Big Data in their efforts to compare research trends and identify new areas for research.},

	abstract = {Estimation of influenza-like illness (ILI) using search trends activity was intended to supplement traditional surveillance systems, and was a motivation  behind the development of Google Flu Trends (GFT). However, several studies have  previously reported large errors in GFT estimates of ILI in the US. Following  recent release of time-stamped surveillance data, which better reflects real-time  operational scenarios, we reanalyzed GFT errors. Using three data sources-GFT: an  archive of weekly ILI estimates from Google Flu Trends; ILIf: fully-observed ILI  rates from ILINet; and, ILIp: ILI rates available in real-time based on partial  reporting-five influenza seasons were analyzed and mean square errors (MSE) of  GFT and ILIp as estimates of ILIf were computed. To correct GFT errors, a random  forest regression model was built with ILI and GFT rates from the previous three  weeks as predictors. An overall reduction in error of 44\% was observed and the  errors of the corrected GFT are lower than those of ILIp. An 80\% reduction in  error during 2012/13, when GFT had large errors, shows that extreme failures of  GFT could have been avoided. Using autoregressive integrated moving average  (ARIMA) models, one- to four-week ahead forecasts were generated with two  separate data streams: ILIp alone, and with both ILIp and corrected GFT. At all  forecast targets and seasons, and for all but two regions, inclusion of GFT  lowered MSE. Results from two alternative error measures, mean absolute error and  mean absolute proportional error, were largely consistent with results from MSE.  Taken together these findings provide an error profile of GFT in the US,  establish strong evidence for the adoption of search trends based 'nowcasts' in  influenza forecast systems, and encourage reevaluation of the utility of this  data source in diverse domains.},

ARGO not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza epidemics but also captures changes in people’s online search behavior over time. ARGO is also flexible, self-correcting, robust, and scalable, making it a potentially powerful tool that can be used for real-time tracking of other social events at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions.},

	abstract = {Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked who they intend to vote for. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

No comparison considering all available German data on actual election results and the confidence intervals based on pre-election polls has been published. In the study reported here only 69\% of confidence intervals covered the election result, whereas statistically 95\% would have to be expected.

	abstract = {Search analytics and trends data is widely used by media, politicians, economists, and scientists in various decision-making processes. The data providers often use sampling when calculating the request results, due to the huge data volume that would need to be processed otherwise. The representativity of such samples is typically assured by the providers. Often, limited or no information about the reliability and validity of the service or the sampling confidence are provided by the services and, as a consequence, the data quality has to be assured by the users themselves, before using it for further analysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract Google Trends data are a popular data source for research, but raw data are frequency-inconsistent: daily data fail to capture long-run trends. This issue has gone unnoticed in the literature. In addition, sampling noise can be substantial. We develop a procedure (available in an R-package), which solves both issues at once. We apply this procedure to construct long-run, frequency-consistent daily economic indices for three German-speaking countries. The resulting indices are significantly correlated with traditional leading economic indicators while being available in real time. We discuss potential applications across disciplines and spanning well beyond business cycle analysis.},
